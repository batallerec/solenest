2. **"Failed to send email"**
   - Verify your EmailJS service is properly configured
   - Check that your email template ID matches the one in your environment variables
   - Ensure your email service is active in EmailJS dashboard

3. **Environment variables not loading**
   - Make sure your `.env` file starts with `VITE_`
   - Restart your development server
   - Check that the `.env` file is not in `.gitignore`

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   - Navigate to the contact section
   - Fill out and submit the form
   - Check your email inbox

   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```
   - Test the same process on the production build
   - Deploy to your hosting platform
   - Test on the live website

The contact form sends these variables to your email template:
